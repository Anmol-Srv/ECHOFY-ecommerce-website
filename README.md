# ECHOFY E-commerce Website Documentation

## Overview
The ECHOFY E-commerce Website is a project developed by Anmol-Srv, hosted on GitHub. It is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. The project is designed to be responsive and includes several components, context, libraries, and styles.

## Repository Structure
The repository consists of several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `components`: This directory contains various React components used in the project.
- `context`: This directory is used for context-based state management.
- `lib`: This directory contains various libraries used in the project.
- `mernkart`: This directory contains files related to the MERN stack implementation.
- `pages`: This directory contains the pages of the Next.js application.
- `public`: This directory contains public assets.
- `styles`: This directory contains CSS files for styling the application.
- `.env`: This file is used for environment variables.
- `.eslintrc.json`: This file is used for configuring ESLint.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and directories that Git should ignore.
- `README.md`: This file provides basic information about the project and instructions on how to get started.
- `jsconfig.json`: This file is used for configuring JavaScript in the project.
- `next.config.js`: This file is used for configuring Next.js.
- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: These files are used for managing the project's dependencies.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you need to run the development server. This can be done using one of the following commands:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

After running the development server, you can open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
